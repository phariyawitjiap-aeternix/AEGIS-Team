## Purpose
Generate and maintain ISO/IEC 29110 Basic profile compliant work products from AEGIS agent outputs. Covers both Project Management (PM) and Software Implementation (SI) processes.

## When to Use
- After sprint planning to generate/update Project Plan (PM.1) and Meeting Record
- After daily standups to update Progress Status Record (PM.2)
- When scope changes to log Change Requests (PM.2)
- When issues or defects found to update Correction Register (PM.3)
- After /aegis-breakdown to generate Requirements Specification + Traceability Matrix initial (SI.2)
- After Iron Man architecture spec to generate Design Document + Traceability Matrix design links (SI.3)
- After Spider-Man implementation to generate Test Cases document + Traceability Matrix code+test links (SI.4)
- After /aegis-qa to generate Test Report + Traceability Matrix final verification (SI.5)
- After QA gate pass and customer sign-off to generate Acceptance Record (PM.4)
- At release time to generate Software Configuration (SI.6)
- When auditing compliance gaps via /aegis-compliance check

## ISO 29110 Basic Profile — Work Products

### PM Process (runs throughout project)

| Activity | Work Product | When Created | When Updated |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| PM.1 Project Planning | Project Plan | Project start | Each sprint/iteration start |
| PM.1 Project Planning | Project Repository | Project start | Continuously |
| PM.2 Execution | Progress Status Record | Each standup/status | Throughout sprint |
| PM.2 Execution | Change Requests | When scope changes | As needed |
| PM.2 Execution | Meeting Records | Every formal review | Every ceremony |
| PM.3 Assessment | Correction Register | When issues found | Throughout project |
| PM.4 Closure | Acceptance Record | Sprint/project end | Customer sign-off |

### SI Process (technical lifecycle — maps to sprint activities)

| Activity | Work Product | When Created | Sprint Phase |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| SI.1 Initiation | (uses Project Plan) | Sprint start | Planning |
| SI.2 Requirements | Requirements Specification | When reqs defined | /aegis-breakdown, /super-spec |
| SI.2 Requirements | Traceability Matrix (start) | With reqs | /aegis-breakdown |
| SI.3 Design | Software Design Document | Before coding | /aegis-team-build (Iron Man phase) |
| SI.3 Design | Traceability Matrix (update) | With design | /aegis-team-build (Iron Man phase) |
| SI.4 Construction | Software Components | During coding | /aegis-team-build (Spider-Man phase) |
| SI.4 Construction | Test Cases & Procedures | During coding | /aegis-team-build (Spider-Man phase) |
| SI.4 Construction | Traceability Matrix (update) | With code+tests | /aegis-team-build (Spider-Man phase) |
| SI.5 Integration & Test | Test Report | After testing | /aegis-qa |
| SI.5 Integration & Test | Traceability Matrix (final) | After testing | /aegis-qa |
| SI.6 Delivery | Software Configuration | Release | /aegis-launch |
| SI.6 Delivery | User Manual (if required) | Release | /aegis-launch |

### KEY PRINCIPLE: Documents at activity time, NOT retroactively

```
## Auto-Generation Triggers (REAL-TIME, not batch)

When /aegis-breakdown runs (SI.2):
  → Coulson auto-generates: Requirements Specification + Traceability Matrix (initial)

When /aegis-team-build runs — Iron Man phase (SI.3):
  → Coulson auto-generates: Software Design Document + Traceability Matrix (design links)

When /aegis-team-build runs — Spider-Man phase (SI.4):
  → Coulson auto-generates: Test Cases document + Traceability Matrix (code+test links)

When /aegis-qa runs (SI.5):
  → Coulson auto-generates: Test Report + Traceability Matrix (final verification)

When /aegis-sprint plan runs (PM.1):
  → Coulson auto-generates: Project Plan update + Meeting Record (planning)

When /aegis-sprint standup runs (PM.2):
  → Coulson auto-generates: Progress Status Record entry

When /aegis-kanban move ... --force or bug found (PM.3):
  → Coulson auto-generates: Correction Register entry

When /aegis-sprint close runs (PM.4):
  → Coulson auto-generates: Acceptance Record + Meeting Record (review+retro)

When /aegis-launch runs (SI.6):
  → Coulson auto-generates: Software Configuration + User Manual (if needed)

- **NOTE**: Test Cases are created IN SI.4 (during construction), NOT just before testing. They validate the design.

#### SI.5 — Test Report
- **Content**: Test execution summary, pass/fail counts, defects found, QA verdict, verification results, validation results
- **Source data**: Vision execution results + War Machine verdict (_aegis-output/qa/)
- **Auto-trigger**: When /aegis-qa run completes (SI.5 activity)
- **Location**: _aegis-output/iso-docs/SI-05-test-report/

### Enforcement

Coulson MUST validate H2 skeleton compliance before writing any ISO doc:
```python
REQUIRED = {
    "PM.01": ["Project Scope", "Tasks & Activities", "Effort Estimates",
              "Schedule & Milestones", "Resources (Agents, Humans, Tools)",
              "Risk Identification", "Version Control Strategy",
              "Lifecycle Model", "Acceptance Criteria",
              "Do's and Don'ts (guardrails)", "Sign-off"],
    "SI.01": ["System Overview", "Stakeholders & Roles",
              "Functional Requirements (FR-###)",
              "Non-Functional Requirements (NFR-###)", "Constraints",
              "Assumptions", "Acceptance Criteria",
              "Do's and Don'ts (guardrails)", "Sign-off & Baseline"],
    # ...
}
# Before write: check every required H2 exists, in order.
# If missing: DO NOT WRITE. Return error to Nick Fury.
```

## Document Lifecycle

Every ISO 29110 document follows this lifecycle:

| Stage | Action | Responsible |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Draft** | Generated by Coulson from source data | Coulson |
| **Review** | Checked for completeness and consistency | Black Panther |
| **Approved** | Formal approval (or escalation to human) | Captain America |
| **Baselined** | Version-tagged in git via commit | Captain America + git |

Status is tracked in a header block at the top of each document:
```markdown
---
document_id: SI.2
title: Requirements Specification
version: 1.2
status: Approved
last_updated: 2026-03-24
author: coulson
reviewer: black-panther
approver: captain-america
---
```

---

## Traceability Matrix Format

```markdown
# Traceability Matrix

| Req ID | Requirement | Design Ref | Code Ref | Test Case | Test Result | Status |
|--------|------------|------------|----------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| REQ-001 | <text> | design-doc#section-2 | src/auth.ts | TC-001 | PASS | Verified |
| REQ-002 | <text> | design-doc#section-3 | src/api.ts | TC-002 | FAIL | Open |
```

**Computation method**: Coulson scans and cross-references:
1. Requirement IDs from _aegis-output/breakdown/ and iso-docs/SI-01-requirements-spec/current.md
2. Design section anchors from iso-docs/SI-03-design-doc/current.md
3. Code file references from Spider-Man implementation commits
4. Test case IDs from _aegis-output/qa/ test plans
5. Test results from _aegis-output/qa/results/

**Lifecycle**: Matrix starts at SI.2 (requirements only), gains design links at SI.3, gains code+test links at SI.4, gains test results at SI.5. The SAME matrix file is updated — not recreated.

---

## Workflow

1. Coulson receives TaskAssignment (from Captain America or triggered by pipeline event)
2. Coulson reads source data from _aegis-output/ and .aegis/brain/
3. Coulson generates or updates the target ISO document
4. Coulson stamps document with version, date, and status=Draft
5. If traceability matrix is affected, Coulson updates it (not regenerates — updates)
6. Coulson sends StatusUpdate to Captain America confirming document generation
7. Black Panther reviews document for completeness (Gate 3: Compliance)
8. Captain America approves or escalates to human

## Inputs
- Agent outputs in _aegis-output/ (specs, reviews, QA results, breakdowns)
- Sprint data in .aegis/brain/sprints/
- Backlog in .aegis/brain/backlog.md

## Outputs
- ISO 29110 documents in _aegis-output/iso-docs/
- Traceability matrix in _aegis-output/iso-docs/SI-02-traceability-matrix/current.md

## Agent Routing
- **Primary**: Coulson (document generation)
- **Assist**: Songbird (for prose-heavy sections like executive summaries)
- **Review**: Black Panther (document completeness check)
- **Approval**: Captain America (formal sign-off)

## Examples
```
# Generate all missing ISO docs
/aegis-compliance generate

# Check compliance gaps
/aegis-compliance check
> Missing: PM.2 Progress Status, PM.3 Correction Register
> Outdated: PM.1 Project Plan (last updated 3 sprints ago)

# Update traceability matrix
/aegis-compliance matrix
> Traceability matrix updated: 12 requirements, 10 traced, 2 gaps found
> Gap: REQ-007 has no test case
> Gap: REQ-011 has no design reference
```
