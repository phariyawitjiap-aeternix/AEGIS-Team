# tools/aegis-brain-graph/hook.sh — debounced PostToolUse hook (sprint-v12-04)
#
# Behavior:
#   - Spawns a background coalescer that holds a flock for 3s, then runs an
#     incremental graph build.
#   - If a coalescer is already running (lock held), this invocation is a
#     no-op — the existing one will absorb the change.
#   - Returns to the parent (Claude Code) in ~1ms, never blocks the user.
#   - Fail-OPEN per DoD §2: any internal error → exit 0 with optional warning.
#
# Spec: AEGIS Knowledge-Layer Mega Plan v1.1, sprint v12-04 story E.

# Background coalescer: lock → sleep N → build → unlock.
# Non-blocking lock; if held, this is a duplicate invocation within the
# debounce window — exit immediately without rebuild.
#
# v15-16: debounce raised from 3s to 10s. Heavy edit bursts (e.g.
# multi-file refactors) used to re-trigger ~5 rebuilds in 15s; the
# graph data is informational, not load-bearing, so a longer window
# is fine. Trade-off: staleness banner on SessionStart shows up
# sooner if a session ends mid-burst. Override via env if needed.
