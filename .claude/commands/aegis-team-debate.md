You MUST execute ALL of the following steps NOW. Do not explain — just do it.

## Step 1: Get the Topic

The user's message contains the debate topic. If empty, use: "$ARGUMENTS"
If still empty, ask the user: "What architecture decision should we debate?"

## Step 2: Threshold Check

Evaluate the debate complexity:
- If it's a simple binary choice (e.g., "tabs vs spaces") → run in **SOLO mode**: use a single Agent (Iron Man) to analyze pros/cons and recommend. Skip team creation. Go to Step 6.
- If it's a real architecture decision with trade-offs, unknown requirements, or multiple valid options → run in **TEAM mode**: proceed to Step 3.

Report which mode was selected and why.

## Step 3: Create Team

Call TeamCreate:
- team_name: "aegis-debate"
- description: "Architecture debate: [TOPIC]"

## Step 4: Spawn 4 Teammates (all in parallel)

Call Agent tool 4 times in a SINGLE message (parallel). All agents run in-process.

1. Agent with subagent_type="iron-man", team_name="aegis-debate", name="iron-man", mode="bypassPermissions", run_in_background=true
   Prompt: "You are 📐 Iron Man the architect on team aegis-debate. Read .claude/agents/iron-man.md for your persona. TOPIC: [TOPIC]. Propose 2-3 architecture options with clear trade-offs for each. Include: scalability, maintainability, cost, complexity, team skill requirements. SUCCESS CRITERIA: Each option has pros, cons, and a recommended use case. Send your proposals to all teammates via SendMessage."

2. Agent with subagent_type="spider-man", team_name="aegis-debate", name="spider-man", mode="bypassPermissions", run_in_background=true
   Prompt: "You are ⚡ Spider-Man the implementer on team aegis-debate. Read .claude/agents/spider-man.md for your persona. TOPIC: [TOPIC]. Wait for iron-man's proposals. Then evaluate each option from an implementation perspective: effort estimate, migration complexity, dependency impact, testing difficulty. SUCCESS CRITERIA: Each option rated by implementation feasibility (Easy/Medium/Hard) with specific reasoning. Send your evaluation to captain-america via SendMessage."

3. Agent with subagent_type="loki", team_name="aegis-debate", name="loki", mode="bypassPermissions", run_in_background=true
   Prompt: "You are 🔴 Loki the devil's advocate on team aegis-debate. Read .claude/agents/loki.md for your persona. TOPIC: [TOPIC]. Wait for iron-man's proposals. Then challenge EVERY option: What could go wrong? What assumptions are wrong? What's the worst case? What are they not considering? SUCCESS CRITERIA: At least 2 challenges per option with severity rating. Send your challenges to captain-america via SendMessage."

4. Agent with subagent_type="captain-america", team_name="aegis-debate", name="captain-america", mode="bypassPermissions", run_in_background=true
   Prompt: "You are 🧭 Captain America the navigator on team aegis-debate. Read .claude/agents/captain-america.md for your persona. TOPIC: [TOPIC]. Wait for input from iron-man (proposals), spider-man (feasibility), and loki (challenges). Then synthesize into a final Architecture Decision Record (ADR). Write the ADR to _aegis-brain/resonance/architecture-decisions.md (append, don't overwrite). SUCCESS CRITERIA: ADR contains: context, options considered, decision, rationale, consequences, and dissenting views. Send the decision summary to the team lead via SendMessage."

## Step 5: Report to user

```
🛡️ AEGIS Debate Team Spawned!

📐 Iron Man (proposer) — Designing options...
⚡ Spider-Man (feasibility) — Waiting for proposals...
🔴 Loki (challenger) — Waiting to challenge...
🧭 Captain America (synthesizer) — Waiting to write ADR...

Pipeline: Iron Man → [Spider-Man + Loki] (parallel) → Captain America
View agents: Shift+Down | Back to main: Shift+Up
```

## Step 6: Integration (after all agents complete)

1. Read Captain America's ADR from _aegis-brain/resonance/architecture-decisions.md
2. Present the decision:
   - Chosen option and rationale
   - Key trade-offs acknowledged
   - Dissenting views (from Loki)
   - Implementation notes (from Spider-Man)
3. Ask user: "Do you agree with this decision? If not, we can re-debate with constraints."
4. Send shutdown_request to each teammate, then TeamDelete

## Failure Handling

If any agent fails to respond within a reasonable time:
1. Check agent status via team tools
2. If stuck → send a nudge message with simplified instructions
3. If errored → report error to user, proceed with available results
4. If multiple fail → abort team, report partial results, suggest retry

> **Optional tmux mode**: For visual split panes, exit Claude Code and run:
> `~/AEGIS-Team/aegis-team.sh --team debate --task "your task"`
> Note: tmux mode has known permission bugs (#26479). In-process mode (default) is recommended.
> Use **Shift+Down** to view agent activity in-process.
