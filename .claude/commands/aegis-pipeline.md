## Quick Reference
Three-phase analysis pipeline using subagents. Phase 1 (Research): Forge scans codebase
and dependencies, Muse scans docs — Gate 1 validates completeness. Phase 2 (Analysis):
Sage does architecture, Vigil does quality, Havoc does adversarial — Gate 2 checks
contradictions. Phase 3 (Synthesis): Navi synthesizes and formats final report. Context
budget checks between every phase. Requires sufficient context budget to complete.

## Full Instructions

### Pre-Flight Check
- Run context budget estimation.
- Full pipeline requires approximately 25-35% of context budget.
- If insufficient budget:
  ```
  ⚠️ Insufficient context budget for full pipeline.
  Current: [X]% used | Pipeline needs: ~30%
  Options:
  1. Run /compact first to free space
  2. Run individual phases manually
  3. Start a fresh session
  ```
  - Do not proceed if >70% context already used.

### Phase 1 — Research (Parallel Subagents)

**Forge — Codebase Scan:**
- Scan project directory structure and report hierarchy.
- Identify: languages used, frameworks, key directories.
- Map: entry points, configuration files, build systems.
- Output: structured codebase map.

**Forge — Dependency Gathering:**
- Read package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, Cargo.toml, or equivalent.
- List all direct dependencies with versions.
- Note any outdated or deprecated packages (if detectable).
- Output: dependency inventory.

**Muse — Documentation Scan:**
- Find and read: README, CONTRIBUTING, docs/, wiki/, *.md files.
- Assess: documentation completeness, accuracy, freshness.
- Note: gaps, outdated sections, missing docs.
- Output: documentation assessment.

**All research tasks run in parallel where possible.**

#### GATE 1: Research Validation (Navi)
- Verify all three research outputs are complete.
- Check for missing data or scan failures.
- If any research is incomplete, retry that specific task.
- If research is complete: "Gate 1 PASSED — Research complete. Proceeding to analysis."
- **Context check**: Estimate remaining budget before proceeding.

### Phase 2 — Deep Analysis (Parallel/Team)

**Sage — Architecture Analysis:**
- Analyze: system architecture, design patterns, module boundaries.
- Evaluate: coupling, cohesion, separation of concerns.
- Identify: architectural strengths and weaknesses.
- Map: data flow, dependency graph, critical paths.
- Output: architecture assessment with diagrams (text-based).

**Vigil — Code Quality Review:**
- Review: code style consistency, error handling, edge cases.
- Check: test coverage, test quality, testing patterns.
- Identify: code smells, anti-patterns, tech debt.
- Evaluate: security practices, input validation, auth patterns.
- Output: quality scorecard with specific findings.

**Havoc — Adversarial Analysis:**
- Challenge: architectural decisions — what could go wrong?
- Probe: failure modes, scalability limits, single points of failure.
- Test: security assumptions — what is assumed but not verified?
- Question: "What happens when [X] fails?" for each critical component.
- Output: risk assessment with severity ratings.

**Analysis tasks run in parallel where possible.**

#### GATE 2: Analysis Validation (Vigil)
- Review all three analysis outputs for completeness.
- Check for contradictions between analyses.
  - If Sage says architecture is solid but Havoc found critical flaws → flag.
  - If Vigil's quality review contradicts Sage's patterns → investigate.
- Resolve contradictions by noting both perspectives.
- If analyses are complete: "Gate 2 PASSED — Analysis complete. Proceeding to synthesis."
- **Context check**: Estimate remaining budget before proceeding.

### Phase 3 — Synthesis (Sequential)

**Navi — Synthesis:**
- Combine all research and analysis outputs.
- Organize by theme, not by agent.
- Resolve any remaining contradictions with balanced perspective.
- Prioritize findings by impact and actionability.
- Structure:
